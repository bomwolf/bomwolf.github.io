<p>spinosaur means spined lizard, was a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in what is now, North America during the cretaceous period. This species was known first from Egyptian remains discovered in 1912 and described by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer in 1915. The original remains were destroyed in World War II  due to allied bombins on a German museum, but in recent years another has been found. Spinosaurus has been estimated to grow up to 15 metres in length and 19 tonnes in weight. the skull of the spinosaurus is very similar to that of modern crocidillians,  spinosaur hunted terrestrial and aquatic prey like modern day crocodiles. It also lived in water and on land. Many scientist believe that the spinosaur had skin between it's spikes creating a sail that it would have used to cool down, warm up and in courtship and dominance displays.  </p>

spinosaurus is the largest known carnivorous dinosaur being larger than Tyranosaurus, Gigonatosaurus, and Irritator, it is not the largest dinosaur as it is smaller than some Herbivorous dinosaurs. Only 2 complete spinosaur fossils have been found. Spinosaur gradually died out due to a decrease in the swamps it lived in, this hapened when sea levels rose it lost it's most important advantage, the ability so sustain itself of aquatic creatures.  </P>
